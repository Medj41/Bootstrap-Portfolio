# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Overview
This repository showcases the work I've done for the Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio. The project involved constructing a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

Before I Began
I successfully implemented the assignment, utilizing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. While acknowledging the upcoming shift to JavaScript in the next unit, I recognize the importance of maintaining a solid understanding of HTML/CSS for a better grasp of JavaScript in web page manipulation.

My Commits
I have actively and consistently committed changes on GitHub, ensuring a transparent progression of my work and learning journey. I made a conscious effort to provide commit messages to clearly convey the nature of each change.

Steps I have carried out for this project

I created a repository named Bootstrap-Portfolio.

I successfully cloned the Bootstrap-Portfolio repository to my local machine.
I set Up the Folder Structure

Following the instructions, I established the specified folder structure, including index.html, a css folder with style.css, and an images folder.

I recreated my portfolio site using Bootstrap components:
Implemented a Navigation bar with links for easy navigation.
Developed a hero section (jumbotron) featuring relevant information and a picture.
Constructed a work section with Bootstrap cards for each project, complete with placeholder images and project overviews.
Listed anticipated learning skills in a skills section.
Incorporated an about/contact section within the same row.
Designed a footer section with hyperlinks and hover effects.

I haven't used of media queries in accordance with the instructions and have been using the bootstrap breakpoints instead.

I successfully deployed the Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
